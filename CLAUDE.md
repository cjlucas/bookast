# CRITICAL: MEMORY MANAGEMENT
**CLAUDE'S PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY**: Actively maintain this CLAUDE.md file throughout the project. Update it immediately when:
- User makes important decisions
- Implementation details are finalized
- New requirements are added
- Project direction changes
This is ESSENTIAL for maintaining project context across conversations.

# implementation-decisions
- **Language**: Go (chosen for simplicity and easy binary deployment)
- **Audio metadata library**: github.com/dhowden/tag (most popular, actively maintained, supports MP3/M4A/etc)
- **Supported formats**: MP3, M4A, M4B, AAC, FLAC, OGG
- **Directory structure**: Flat directories only (no nested folders for now)
- **Metadata sources**: ID3 tags first, fall back to filenames
- **Episode ordering**: Alphanumeric sorting
- **URL structure**: Directory name becomes part of URL path (e.g., `--base-url https://foo.bar/audiobooks hp1` â†’ `https://foo.bar/audiobooks/hp1/file.mp3`)
- **URL encoding**: Proper escaping for spaces and special characters
- **RSS output**: One RSS file per directory, generated in source directory as `podcast.rss`
- **CLI interface**: `bookast --base-url <url> <directory>` (base-url is required)
- **Error handling**: Unix conventions - errors to stderr, proper exit codes, fail on unparseable files
- **Git workflow**: No branches - commit directly to main
