This is bookast, a simple podcast feed generator for audiobooks. It's goal is to leverage staic asset deployment to easily serve up audiobooks as podcast feeds by specifying a directory which contains audiofiles and optionally a cover image, it shuold generate an rss file that then can be manually uploaded to a staticc filehost.

# CRITICAL: MEMORY MANAGEMENT
**CLAUDE'S PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY**: Actively maintain this CLAUDE.md file throughout the project. Update it immediately when:
- User makes important decisions
- Implementation details are finalized
- New requirements are added
- Project direction changes
This is ESSENTIAL for maintaining project context across conversations.

# implementation-decisions
- **Language**: Go (chosen for simplicity and easy binary deployment)
- **Audio metadata library**: github.com/dhowden/tag (most popular, actively maintained, supports MP3/M4A/etc)
- **Supported formats**: MP3, M4A, M4B, AAC, FLAC, OGG
- **Directory structure**: Flat directories only (no nested folders for now)
- **Metadata sources**: ID3 tags first, fall back to filenames
- **Episode ordering**: Alphanumeric sorting
- **URL structure**: Directory name becomes part of URL path (e.g., `--base-url https://foo.bar/audiobooks hp1` â†’ `https://foo.bar/audiobooks/hp1/file.mp3`)
- **URL encoding**: Proper escaping for spaces and special characters
- **RSS output**: One RSS file per directory, generated in source directory as `podcast.rss`
- **CLI interface**: `bookast --base-url <url> <directory>` (base-url is required)
- **Error handling**: Unix conventions - errors to stderr, proper exit codes, fail on unparseable files
- **Git workflow**: No branches - commit directly to main
- **Description fallback**: Use title as description when comment is empty or contains technical metadata like "iTunPGAP"
- **Episode pubDate**: Use current time + index (1 second intervals) for consistent chronological ordering in podcast clients

# library-selection-criteria
- **Popularity**: Must be widely used (check GitHub stars, imports, usage)
- **Active maintenance**: Recent commits, active issues/PRs, responsive maintainers
- **These are critical factors when choosing external dependencies**

# debugging-tips
- **Metadata debugging**: Use `mediainfo <audiofile>` to inspect actual metadata fields and compare against RSS output
- **URL encoding verification**: Check generated RSS URLs match expected encoding patterns
